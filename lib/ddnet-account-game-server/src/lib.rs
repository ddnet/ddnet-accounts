//! This crate contains a base implementation for
//! a game server to do account related operations.
//! It helps sending data, storing results persistently.
//! This crate is not intended for creating UI,
//! any game logic, database implementations nor knowing about the communication details
//! (be it UDP, HTTP or other stuff).
//! It uses interfaces to abstract such concepts away.
